# Navigation
There is a very basic and naive navigation context that manages the current
screen. Obviously the routes will only work within the runtime of the app,
given the static nature of the demo (i.e. no server).

I would typically use [https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router](React Router)
for routing, but opted for this approach to avoid using third party libraries
as per the spec.

# TODO

+ style - anchor hover state
+ footer social anchors - hover shows blue svg

+ Integrate prop-types
